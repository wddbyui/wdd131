        <h1>Ponder - Computational Thinking</h1>
        <p>Computational Thinking is the way programmers think when they are solving problems with code. It helps the programmer plan what the program should do before they start writing the code. It's preparing step-by-step instructions that a computer can follow.</p>
        <h2>3 Steps of Computational Thinking:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Break the problem into smaller parts</li>
          <li>Look for repeated or similar steps</li>
          <li>Make a list of steps</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You want to write an application that lets the user choose their own theme or interface environment. They will choose from 3 different themes that have a different background and font style for the app.</p>
        <p>This video demonstrated the idea that you have in your head:</p>

        <h2>Let's go through the Computationals Thinking steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Break the problem into smaller parts</li>
            <ul>
              <li>I need to give my user a way to choose the theme</li>
              <li>Once they choose the theme, I need to change the theme according to what they chose.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Look for repeated or similar steps</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The process of choosing a theme will be repeatable if the user chooses another theme. They can change it repeatedly to different themes.</li>
              <li>Two of the same properties will be changed: the background and the font.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Make a list of steps</li>
            <ul>
              <li>I'll have a drop-down menu to allow the user to choose a theme.</li>
              <li>Listen for the drop-down menu option value to change.</li>
              <li>When it changes retrieve the value they choose.</li>
              <li>According to what theme they choose, change the background image and font style of my page to match that theme.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>This list of steps is also called pseudocode. Pseudocode uses plain language (or the language you speak and write in) along with programming logic. It won't run on a computer, so you don't have to have syntax perfect, but it helps you focus on logic and step without worrying about code.</p>
        <p>As you get to know your coding language better your pseudocode might get a little closer to the programming language. For example:</p>

<Target all the elements I will need for this to run:  the body element to change its background and font, and the drop down menu or select element that I gave the id of ‘theme-select’ to.
