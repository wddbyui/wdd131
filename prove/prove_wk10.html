            <p>Your project should be in a folder called 'recipes'. Make sure you have an index.html page and a separate JavaScript and CSS file. </p>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <p>Continue working with the recipes page that was created. JavaScript will be added to show a random recipe on the page. The user can search for keywords that will be compared to the recipe name, description, and tags to display recipes that contain the search keywords. Those recipes will be sorted by recipe name.</p>
